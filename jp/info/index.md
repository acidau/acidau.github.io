## COVID-19 response
_Last updated: 15 February 2022_


**JP services are not classified as essential services. All NSW JPs are volunteers.**<br /> It is not unreasonable for NSW JPs to decline services if they or their family are at risk.

NSW statutory declarations can be witnessed by a wider range [authorised witnesses for Commonwealth statutory declarations](https://www.ag.gov.au/legal-system/statutory-declarations/who-can-witness-your-statutory-declaration) until **31 December 2022**. It is now also a permanent provision that oaths, declarations and affidavits may be taken before an Australian legal practitioner. Unlike JPs, persons in the above occupations may charge a fee for service.

For the latest information on JP services, [check the Department of Communities and Justice website](https://www.jp.nsw.gov.au/).

Most community desks run by NSW Justices Association (in shopping centres and courts) are responding to the current health situation and remain closed. [Local court desks are closed until at least **14 March 2022** by order of the Chief Magistrate.](https://www.localcourt.nsw.gov.au/local-court/arrangements-for-covid-19--coronavirus-/chief-magistrate-s-memorandum.html)

## Remote witnessing by audio-visual link for NSW documents
_Last updated: 20 December 2021_

NSW JPs may now witness the **execution of certain documents** by audio visual link, replacing the pilot scheme and provisions made in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. [Effective 29 November 2021](https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/bills/Pages/bill-details.aspx?pk=3910), this is a permanent feature of the Electronic Transactions Act. **This does not include _Commonwealth_ affidavits and certified copies, both of which must still be done physically.** Electronic signatures are not to be used - wet signatures only.

Notably, Section 14I now permits witnessing of NSW documents, even if the **signatory** is outside the jurisdiction. Despite the wording of the act, I am yet to receive further advice on whether a NSW JP may act while physically outside the jurisdiction under this part.

The suggested wording is: _"This document was signed [in counterpart] and witnessed over audio visual link in accordance with section 14G of the Electronic Transactions Act 2000"_[.](https://www.lawsociety.com.au/sites/default/files/2020-10/COVID-19%20Witnessing%20of%20Documents_%20FAQs%207%20October%202020%20CLEAN.pdf)

[The Factsheet for JPs (updated for 2022) is available on the DCJ website.](https://www.jp.nsw.gov.au/Documents/witnessing-legal-documents-remotely-jp-factsheet.pdf)

_Tool last updated: 20 March 2020_<br />

The tool has been decommissioned, and a more elegant version is in the works.<br /><br />

This interactive tool gives general advice on **what to prepare when visiting a JP in person**, to save those trips back and forth!<br />
It also only takes into account face-to-face services and not electronic witnessing.<br />
As well as using the tool, please use your best judgment when requesting or providing these services.
