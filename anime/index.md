_Last updated: 10 September 2021_

I started my journey with Japanese animation in late high school through its music. I've been involved with the Sydney anime scene ever since, through organising meetups, creative output, and helping run conventions.

# the list

‚≠ê = hands down recommend as a good show/series in its subgenre. <br />
üìï = bonus points for well-written stories and plots, usually a credit to its source material.

**Wholesome chicken soup for the anime soul, in rough order of recommendation.**
* _Super Cub_: you can go anywhere on a motorcycle, I'm told. Love the art and gradually paced MC development :) ‚≠ê
* _Yuru Camp._ There's a reason why we also call it 'Comfy Camp'. I am very much looking forward to the second season! ‚≠ê
* _Ms Kobayashi's Dragon Maid_- worth watching just for the warmth in Season 2's writing. üìï
* _Hyouka._ High schoolers do mystery! ‚≠ê
* _Kakushigoto._ Comedic and heartwarming series from the author of _Zetubou-sensei._ ‚≠êüìï
* _Violet Evergarden_ and its side movie _Eternity and the Auto Machine Doll_. Cried every second episode, honestly. üìï
*  _Koisuru Asteroid -_ Earth Science, the anime.
* _Gourmet Girl Graffiti_- wholesome girls cooking for each other for 12 episodes.
* _The Demon Girl Next Door / Machikado Mazoku._ Wacky, not-quite-magical girl comedy.
* _Non Non Biyori_ - both seasons, in order. [This clip from S2.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DflP5mBsivA)
* _Teasing Master Takagi-san_, both seasons. Stay playful.
* _Tsukigakirei._ Nice and wholesome vanilla romance, wrapped up in one cour. You need a break from more serious drama.
*  _Interviews with Monster Girls._ Teachers going out of their way to help their quirky students fit in.
*  _Asagao to Kase-san_. Fluffy yuri romance OVA with likeable main characters.


**I'm sick of high school characters.**
* _Bartender_ - best watched in order. ‚≠ê
* _Girls' Last Tour._ Simple, haunting and beautiful, as is its soundtrack.‚≠ê
* _Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu_ - both seasons, in order. Three (four?) generations of family drama. Some background Japanese cultural knowledge may increase enjoyment, but overall self-explanatory. ‚≠êüìï


**Rather good films.**
* _I Want To Eat Your Pancreas_ (which, despite the title, is an emotional story). ‚≠ê
* _Mirai._ One of the best animated features I've watched.‚≠êüìï
* _A Silent Voice._
* _Tamako Love Story_, even if you haven't seen the TV anime.
*  _Weathering With You._ Despite all the Shinkai cliches it's a rewarding watch.


**I want to sneak anime into my biology lesson plans.**
* _Cells at Work!_ What we wish our cells and organs could be. ‚≠ê


**I need something light.**
* _Kaguya-sama: Love Is War._ Over-the-top romantic comedy.
*  _Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun._ Also an over-the-top romantic comedy.
* _Nichijou_ - any episode order will do. ‚≠ê
* _Servant x Service_ - fun municipal office shenanigans! ‚≠ê


**Fine, maybe _some_ drama. (And music!)**
* _Aobuta series (Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai etc)._ Nice character dynamics in a reasonably believable sci-fi. The movie is worth it, too. ‚≠ê
* _Hibike! Euphonium_ - because bands! Season 2 pays off in spades.
* _Welcome to the Ballroom._ It's not _too_ bad but execution and animation in the first cour were a little wanting. üìï


**Spoil me with scenery.**
* _The Garden of Words._ Or anything Makoto Shinkai on account of his works being _the definition of scenery porn_, but stories are hit and miss.


**Thoughtful 2010s remakes of SF heroes?**
* _Gatchaman Crowds Insight _- if you can get past the first season of _Crowds._
* _SSSS.GRIDMAN._ Follow the series and guess who's the main character.


**Sports!**
* _Ping Pong._ Directed by acclaimed Maasaki Yuasa.
